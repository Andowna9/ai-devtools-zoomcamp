# Most Relevant AI Development Tools

## Chat Applications

Best for asking questions, solving specific errors or even developing small code fragments.

- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/). General knowledge. Still good at helping with coding tasks and setting up projects from scratch.
- [Claude](https://claude.ai/). Specialized in coding. Generally better code structure and readability compared to ChatGPT.

> **Important**: When asking for **intructions about how to run applications locally**, they **may be outdated** in case new package versions are available. This often leads to errors during installation.

## Project Bootstrappers

Best for quickly implementing working prototypes. They reduce the effort of configuring projects manually.

- [Lovable](https://lovable.dev/)
- [Bolt](https://bolt.new/)

## Code Assistants

Best for seamless integration with IDEs, as the AI behaves as an agent that has access to the codebase. Therefore, there is no need of copy-pasting code from chat applications. This is essentially the most productive when focused on programming.

- [VSCode + GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
- [Cursor](https://cursor.com/)

Recommended use:
- Refactoring code with a clear scope
- Debugging and fixing bugs
- Implementing new features on existing code
